expensive-relay, a sybil-free corner of nostr
=============================================

  - a nostr relay implementation based on relayer.
  - uses postgres, which I think must be over version 12 since it uses generated columns.
  - requires users to manually register themselves to be able to publish events and pay a fee. this should prevent spam.
  - aside from that it's basically the same thing as relayer basic.

running
-------

grab a binary from the releases page and run it with the following environment variables:

    HOST=127.0.0.1
    PORT=12345
    DOMAIN=example.com
    POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=postgres://name:pass@localhost:5432/dbname

    # either
    SPARKO_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9737
    SPARKO_TOKEN=tokenwithaccessto_listinvoices_invoicewithdescriptionhash_stream

    # or
    LND_HOST=
    LND_CERT_PATH=
    LND_MACAROON_PATH=

adjust the values above accordingly.

compiling
---------

if you know Go you already know this:

    go get github.com/fiatjaf/expensive-relay

or something like that.
