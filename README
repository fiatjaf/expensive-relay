expensive-relay
===============

  - a nostr relay implementation based on relayer.
  - uses postgres, which I think must be over version 12 since it uses generated columns.
  - requires users to manually register themselves to be able to publish events and pay a fee. this should prevent spam.
  - aside from that it's basically the same thing as relayer basic.

running
-------

grab a binary from the releases page and run it with the following environment variables:

    DOMAIN=example.com POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=postgres://name:pass@localhost:5432/dbname LNBITS_URL=https://infinity.lnbits.com LNBITS_TOKEN=zzz ./expensive-relay

notice that it expects an LNbits _Infinity_ server, not Legend.

it also accepts a HOST and a PORT environment variables.

compiling
---------

if you know Go you already know this:

    go get github.com/fiatjaf/expensive-relay

or something like that.
